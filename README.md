# Mend-the-Gap: Software

This repository contains the full set of software scripts and tools developed by
Joseph Sadden for the Mend-the-Gap collaboration. The scripts and tools here are
provided for all members of the collaboration to use and contribute to. Tools are generally divided up based on the programming language they utilize, as this generally also corresponds to how such tools are run and/or used. See the per-language `README.md` files for more details on how each of these sub-groups fit together into the full set of tools and software developed for this collaboration.
