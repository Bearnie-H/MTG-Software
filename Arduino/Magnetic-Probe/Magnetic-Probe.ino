    DEBUG

    This is the top-level macro which enables all debugging and instrumentation
    behaviour of the program. This will significantly increase the code size and
    decrease the execution speed as a result of the significant logging
    behaviour this typically implies. Comment out or otherwise undefine this
    macro for production or experimental trials where debugging and
    instrumentation can be turned off.

    This section contains the default functions provided by the Arduino
    implementation These functions must be present, with these defined function
    signatures, and provide the two interfaces for providing custom code for the
    controller to execute.

    In essence, the full structure of the Arduino program is roughly as follows:

    void main(void) {
        RunBootloader();

        setup();
        while ( true ) {
            loop();
        }
    }

    where the `RunBootloader()` is a placeholder for whatever system
    initialization the processor runs after a Reset before dropping control to
    the `setup()` and `loop()` functions.
*/
/*
    setup

    This function provides the starting point for the Arduino Sketch. This
    performs all of the non-static program and device initialization before
    passing control on to the `loop()` function as the primary control loop.

    Return (void):
        This function returns nothing to the caller, as all initialization it
        performs must be done through global variables.
*/

void setup(void) {

    // ...

    return;
}

/*
    loop

    This function provides the main control loop of the Arduino program. The
    behaviour provided in this function is called within a while(true) infinite
    loop provided by the implementation, and does not require explicit looping
    to operate indefinitely.

    Return (void):
        This function returns nothing to the caller.

    return;

    This section contains the function definitions for any functions related to
    debugging, logging, or otherwise instrumentation of the controller during
    operation. These functions MUST be optional for the successful functioning
    of the device, as ALL functionality provided in these functions will be
    removed when the top-level DEBUG symbol is undefined.

    A function related to debugging must return void, but may take an arbitrary
    number and type of arguments. These MUST NOT modify any global variables,
    but may read either global constants or variables if required.

    Place empty function definition for the debug-only functions in this

    consisting of only a single return statement. These will be safely optimized
    out during compilation and will produce no runtime penalty for calling when
    running in non-debug mode.
